# Short Stories

Jerry sighed, looking over the Q1 projections. He was going to have to fire some people, unfortunately. God, why couldn't they understand that if they worked harder for him, he wouldn't have to do this. He knew they had their own little lives that needed to be sustained, and he wanted to help them with that - but he needed to survive, too. 

Jerry stood up from his chair, fatigued from the day's work. He peered out over the city's landscape through his window, but the initial joy he had gotten the first time gazing over this view was a distant memory. He pondered asking his assistant to look into other places with a nice view. Maybe something with water.
