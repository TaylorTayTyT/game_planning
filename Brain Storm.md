I want this to be done in 3-6 months. 

The game doesn't have to be original, but I should want to do it. 

Co-op puzzle game maybe? But the thing with that is I need a server for it to be real time.

Is there an offline way for this to be multiplayer? Maybe make the game only possible to solve with two separate accounts?

In that case, how do you make it fun? Time restrictions? learning? Something like that?

Prisoner's dilemma situation, maybe? Maybe you could influence the other person's game?.
