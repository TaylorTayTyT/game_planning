# Background

1. **Was born into poverty**

Why do they deserve it and I don't? I'll play a dirtier game because I have to. 


Tommy is not someone who blames other people when things fail - he will blame himself for not seeing the future, and ruthlessly cut people he thinks he should cut.

# Short Stories

From the darkness, Tommy strided in. His gliding black coat made the man's presence like an overwhelming pressure, something that could cover you whole and wipe you from existence. 

He sat at the table, legs crossed and the smoke of his cigar twirling madly into the air. 

"Look, I don't have time for bullshit. You fucked up, you fucked up real bad, and when you fuck up real bad I don't intend to be the nice guy."

"Come on," I protested weakly. "It wasn't my faul-."

"You're fired." He got up to go. 

"What?" I scurried after him. "Tommy, I got a kid on the way. My family is in trouble and - you *know* that! You know all that, and you know it wasn't my fault everything went sour!"

Tommy dismissively waved his hand, as if I were an annoying insect buzzing around his head. 

"She's pregnant, you're pregnant, your mom's pregnant, I don't care. My mom was pregnant and she didn't care. Don't ever show your face to me again."
